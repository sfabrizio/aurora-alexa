## Install

This project is done on platformio, so it's just a simple upload of the project. 
Just make sure to change config values to your in 'main.cpp'


Thanks to Aurora!

## TODO:
- code segregation, it's everything in the main now.
- find a way to send effects and more parameters from Alexa. Now it's just an on/off with a hardcode effect.
